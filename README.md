# Maximizing Profits: Analyzing Top Earning Apps in the App Store and Google Play

This project explores mobile app market data from the App Store and Google Play to identify what types of apps are most likely to attract users â€” with the goal of helping a developer team make data-driven decisions on which free apps to build for optimal ad-based revenue.

## Project Objective

As a data analyst for a company that develops free-to-download mobile apps, my goal is to:
- Identify app profiles that are likely to perform well in terms of user engagement.
- Focus on apps that attract the highest number of users, given that our primary revenue stream is **in-app advertisements**.

## Datasets Used

- **Google Play Store Apps**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps)
- **Apple App Store Apps**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps)

Both datasets include information on thousands of mobile apps, covering categories, number of installs, reviews, and ratings.

## Python Tools

- Jupyter Notebook
- Loops
- Functions

## Key Insights

- **Games** and **Entertainment** apps tend to dominate the top categories in both stores.
- **Free apps with high install counts** tend to monetize better through ads.
- Certain categories like **Education** and **Productivity** also show strong user engagement with lower competition.
- Data cleaning revealed issues such as duplicate entries, formatting inconsistencies, and the need to filter non-English apps.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data wrangling and cleaning (handling duplicates, missing values, formatting issues)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization to communicate findings
- Business thinking - aligning data insights with revenue models
