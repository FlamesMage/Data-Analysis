# Customers and Products Analysis Using SQL
In this project, I analysed customer and product data to understand key factors driving business decisions. I identified which products to order more or less of based on their revenue and stock ratios. By focusing on high-performing products with high restock needs, I can ensure efficient inventory management. Additionally, I segmented our customer base by behaviour, identifying VIP customers who generate the highest profits, as well as less-engaged customers who could benefit from targeted marketing and re-engagement strategies. Lastly, I calculated the average profit generated by an average customer, providing us with a clear figure to guide our customer acquisition strategy. By forecasting profits from new customers, I can confidently plan future marketing budgets, ensuring a profitable balance between acquisition cost and expected revenue.

This analysis enabled me to make data-driven decisions that optimise product stocking, marketing efforts, and customer acquisition strategies. With the knowledge gained, I can now prioritise resources more effectively, aiming for sustainable growth while maximising returns on investments in both products and customer relationships.


## Project Objectives
- Identify which profitable products to restock.

- Segment customers into groups (VIPs, least engaged, new customers) to align marketing strategies.

- Estimate how much can be spent on acquiring new customers based on average customer profit.

## SQL Techniques Used
- Nested and Correlated Subqueries

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

- JOIN operations

- Aggregation and calculation (SUM, AVG, ROUND)

- Filtering and ordering results

## Key Insights
- High stock ratio products like 1960 BSA Gold Star DBD34 indicate strong demand but low stock, requiring immediate restocking.

- Top VIP customers are concentrated in Spain, USA, and Australia, suggesting targeted loyalty strategies.

- The average customer generates $39,039.59 in lifetime profit, providing a basis for customer acquisition budgeting.
