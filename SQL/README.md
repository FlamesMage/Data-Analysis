# Customers and Products Analysis Using SQL
In this project, I set out to answer three crucial questions that could enhance the business strategy. First, I focused on which products to prioritise for restocking. By analysing revenue and stock ratios, I identified products needing restocking and ranked them by their sales performance and the urgency of stock replenishment. This focused on high-revenue products that would yield the most benefit when restocked.

Next, I turned my attention to customer behaviour. I segmented customers into VIPs and less-engaged groups, using data to suggest tailored marketing strategies for each. For our top customers, I proposed exclusive offers and personalised communication to retain their loyalty. On the other hand, I identified the least engaged customers, who could benefit from re-engagement campaigns and loyalty programs to increase their purchase frequency. 

Lastly, I calculated the average lifetime profit per customer, which served as a foundation for predicting future profits and setting an acquisition budget for new customers. This comprehensive analysis equipped with actionable insights helps to optimise sales, marketing, and customer acquisition efforts for sustainable growth.


## Project Objectives
- Identify which profitable products to restock.

- Segment customers into groups (VIPs, least engaged, new customers) to align marketing strategies.

- Estimate how much can be spent on acquiring new customers based on average customer profit.

## SQL Techniques Used
- Nested and Correlated Subquries

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

- JOIN operations

- Aggregation and calculation (SUM, AVG, ROUND)

- Filtering and ordering results

## Key Insights
- High stock ratio products like 1960 BSA Gold Star DBD34 indicate strong demand but low stock, requiring immediate restocking.

- Top VIP customers are concentrated in Spain, USA, and Australia, suggesting targeted loyalty strategies.

- The average customer generates $39,039.59 in lifetime profit, providing a basis for customer acquisition budgeting.
